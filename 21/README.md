# HV20.21 Threatened Cat

You can feed this cat with many different things, but only a certain kind of file can endanger the cat.

Do you find that kind of files? And if yes, can you use it to disclose the flag? Ahhh, by the way: The cat likes to hide its stash in `/usr/bin/catnip.txt`.

**Note:** The cat is currently in hibernation and will take a few seconds to wake up.
