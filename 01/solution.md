# HV20.01 Happy HACKvent 2020

This challenge appears to be similar to the teaser. From the description we already get the hint that the flag might be hidden in the alpha channel of the image. A simple way to check this is again using [Stegsolve](https://github.com/eugenekolo/sec-tools/tree/master/stego/stegsolve/stegsolve). Fortunately, my first impression was correct and I was able to easily extract the flag.
