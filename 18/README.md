# HV20.18 Santa's lost home

Santa has forgotten his password and can no longer access his data. While trying to read the hard disk from another computer he also destroyed an important file. To avoid further damage he made a backup of his home partition. Can you help him recover the data.

When asked he said the only thing he remembers is that he used his name in the password... I thought this was something only a _real human_ would do...
