# HV20.02 Chinese Animals

I've received this note from a friend, who is a Chinese CTF player:

```
恭喜！收旗爲：ＨＶ２０｛獭慬氭敬敧慮琭扵瑴敲晬礭汯癥猭杲慳猭浵搭桯牳ｅ｝
```

Unfortunately, Google Translate wasn't of much help: ![Sloth](./sloth.png)

![Glibberish](./e496ffb6-ee2d-45bc-aa6b-3a81a2de4618.png)

I suspect the data has somehow been messed up while transmitting it.

Sadly, I can't ask my friend about more details. The Great Chinese Firewall is thwarting our attempts to reach each other, and there's no way I'm going to install WeChat on my phone.
