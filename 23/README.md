# HV20.23 Those who make backups are cowards!

Santa tried to get an important file back from his old mobile phone backup. Thankfully he left a post-it note on his phone with the PIN. Sadly Rudolph thought the Apple was real and started eating it (there we go again...). Now only the first of eight digits, a **2**, is still visible...

But maybe you can do something to help him get his important stuff back?
