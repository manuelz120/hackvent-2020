# HV20.11 Chris'mas carol

Since yesterday's challenge seems to have been a bit on the hard side, we're adding a small musical innuendo to relax.

My friend Chris from Florida sent me this score. Enjoy! Is this what you call postmodern?

He also sent [this image](./2e571ba0-57a5-435b-a992-5f02546f9e90.png), but that doesn't look like Miami's skyline to me.

P.S: Also, we're giving another 24h to get full points for the last challenge.
